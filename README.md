 Handyman App

This app allows users to book appointments with handymen, or handymen to have appointments booked.
The app starts on a login page. From there you can either sign up, or log in. If you are a user, you
go to a services page where you can pick what kind of job you want done, edit your profile, or view calls
you've made in the past that have not been completed by the handyman. If you select a job, you can view a list
of different handymen who can do it. From there you can select the handyman, and confirm the appointment.
If you login as a handyman, you go to a page where you can edit your description and what jobs you offer.
You can also edit your profile and view appointments you've had booked. On the appointments page, you can
delete any appointment. From the edit profile page, you can edit any detail of your profile except for your username.
